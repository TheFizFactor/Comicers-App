If you move the series on your filesystem, you will need to remove/re-add it in Comicers.</li><li>While reading from an archive file, Comicers will extract images to a temporary location which is cleared occasionally.</li></ul></li><li>Can I update a series on the filesystem after I import it? <ul><li>Yes, as long as the path to the directory you provided on import remains the same, you can edit it as much as you like (add/remove pages, rename chapters, etc.).
