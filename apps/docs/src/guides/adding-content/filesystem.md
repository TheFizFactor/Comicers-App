# Adding from Filesystem

Adding content from your filesystem.

## Importing a series

1. Go to the `Explorer` page.
2. Select `filesystem` from the dropdown and click `Select Directory`. Optionally select
"Multi-series mode", which can be used for a directory with multiple series.
3. Edit the series details (title, description, etc.) from the popup dialog, and click
`Add series` to add it to your library.

You can view the series you added on the `Library` page. Edit series details by clicking `Edit` on
the series page.

## FAQ

- Can I use `zip`/`rar`/`cbr`/`cbz` chapters?
  - Yes, Comicers supports importing directories that contain an archive file for each chapter.
  Archives should contain only images and should be named in the same way as a chapter directory.
- Does Comicers make a copy of what I import?
  - No, Comicers simply saves the location of the directory you provide and reads from it when
  necessary. If you move the series on your filesystem, you will need to remove/re-add it in Comicers.
  - While reading from an archive file, Comicers will extract images to a temporary location which
  is cleared occasionally.
- Can I update a series on the filesystem after I import it?
  - Yes, as long as the path to the directory you provided on import remains the same, you can edit
  it as much as you like (add/remove pages, rename chapters, etc.). These are updated when you
  refresh the series just like they would be for an external series.

## Technical information

Comicers treats every directory containing an image as a chapter. Therefore, it is
*functional* for any directory layout. The main concern is how metadata for chapters is parsed.

Things to keep in mind:
- Some releases separate a series only by volume. However, Comicers will always list base directories as chapters.
- Currently, Comicers only looks at base-level directory names. If you want metadata to be parsed,
it needs to be included in the name of each of those directories.

Comicers extracts the following from those directory names:

- It attempts to find a chapter number in the form `cXX`. This can have a decimal; e.g. `c201.4`. If a
chapter number is not found, it attempts to find any number (separated by spaces). Finally, it
defaults to the previous chapter number + 1 (rounded down).
- It attempts to find a volume number in the form `vXX`. This can have a decimal. If the volume number is not found, it is omitted.
- It attempts to find a release group in the form `[Release Group]`. If not found, it is omitted.
