# Customize

Customize the application and reader.

All options can be configured from the `Settings` page.

## General

- **Check for Comicers updates automatically**: Check for application updates when starting Comicers.
You can also manually check for updates by clicking the version number in the bottom left.
- **Theme**: Select the light or dark application theme.
- **Backup**: Backup your library to a file, or restore an existing backup.

## Reader

- Page style
  - There are 3 page styles/layouts: single page, double page, and long strip (vertical).
  - With double page or long strip, you can add spacing between the pages.
  - With double page, you can offset the pages. This allows you to ensure that the left/right
  page is displayed as if it were in a real book.
- **Reading direction**: Left-to-right or right-to-left. This also affects keybinds and buttons on the sidebar.
- **Image sizing**: Limit images to the page width and/or height.

## Keybinds

Adjust keybinds for the reader, including for changing page, chapter, layout, and more.
